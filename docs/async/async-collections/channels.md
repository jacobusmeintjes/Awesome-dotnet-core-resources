## Libraries
- [Nito.AsyncEx](https://github.com/StephenCleary/AsyncEx)
  > A helper library for the Task-Based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP).

- [Microsoft.VisualStudio.Threading](https://github.com/microsoft/vs-threading)
  > Async synchronization primitives, async collections, TPL and dataflow extensions. The JoinableTaskFactory allows synchronously blocking the UI thread for async work. 

- [AsyncEnumerator](https://github.com/Dasync/AsyncEnumerable)
  > Introduces `IAsyncEnumerable`, `IAsyncEnumerator`, `ForEachAsync()`, and `ParallelForEachAsync()` and other useful stuff to use with async-await 

- [AsyncIO.DotNet](https://github.com/firenero/AsyncIO)
  > Easy-to-use library for common async IO file system operations. 

- [NeoSmart.AsyncLock](https://github.com/neosmart/AsyncLock)
  > A C# lock replacement for async/await, supporting recursion/re-entrance and asynchronous waits.
